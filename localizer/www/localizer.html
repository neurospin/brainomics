        <h2>Functional Localizer</h2>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.unicog.org/pm/pmwiki.php/Site/FunctionalLocalizer">Functional Localizer</a> is a simple and fast acquisition procedure based on a 5-minute functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence that can be run as easily and as systematically as an anatomical scan. This protocol captures the cerebral bases of auditory and visual perception, motor actions, reading, language comprehension and mental calculation at an individual level. Individual functional maps are reliable and quite precise.
        The procedure is decribed in more detail on the <a href="http://www.unicog.org/pm/pmwiki.php/Site/FunctionalLocalizer">Functional Localizer</a> page.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of subjects were scanned at <a href="http://www-dsv.cea.fr/neurospin/">Neurospin</a> based on this procedure.</p>
        <p>Scientific results obtained using this dataset are described in <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/91">Pinel <i>et al.</i>, 2007</a>. The paper shows that 80% of main maxima (isolated with a 30-minute long acquisition) were detected in this 5-minute design, with an average spatial precision of 6mm.</p>
        <h2>Localizer subset with genetics</h2>
        <p>From the initial Functional Localizer dataset, 94 subjects for whom genetic data had been acquired have been selected.</p>
        <p>This specific subset of 94 subjects is made available through this public online Brainomics/Localizer database.</p>
        <p>Scientific results obtained using this dataset are described in <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/3/817">Pinel <i>et al.</i>, 2012</a>.</p>
        <h2>Genetic data</h2>
        <p>Please note that ethical issues prevent us from making most of the genetic data available online.
        Our framework is technically able to serve such data, but the server has been restricted in its ability to expose SNPs.</p>
