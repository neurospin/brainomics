# Localizer

Source code used in the Brainomics/Localizer subproject.

The CubicWeb cube specific to this Brainomics/Localizer project and
the import script have been made available on a new
[public GitHb repository](https://github.com/neurospin/localizer).
History has not been copied from this repository
to the new repository - on purpose.

For a detailed description have a look at the
[Brainomics/Localizer](https://bioproj.extra.cea.fr/redmine/projects/localizer94/wiki)
project site.
