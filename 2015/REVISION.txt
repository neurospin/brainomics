Reviewer #2:
We are aware of the existence of larger shared databases and we agree
our paper is the technical description of a smaller database.

The data we share is associated to published scientific papers. As such
it should not lack scientific interest. The process of opening and
publishing the data is separate from the initial effort and we believe
it deserves a short publication of its own, possibly more technical in
nature than our initial publications or a standalone publication
describing new data. As a side note, we have pushed the relevant part
of the newly opened Localizer data to NeuroVault, thus contributing to
one of the mentioned larger databases. We felt the description of the
data itself, and of the process of opening and publishing the data,
does fall in the scope of the "Data Sharing" special issue of Neuroimage.

A much larger part of the database, around 2000 subjects, has not been
made public so far for reasons related to regulatory rules. However it
might still be used within the more limited scope of scientific
collaborations. We have attempted to clarify this in the paper.

Finally Nilearn, a Python module for statistical learning on
neuro-imaging data, uses the Brainomics/Localizer data as an example
dataset. The data we share is thus probably used by other researchers,
at least for exploratory purposes.
